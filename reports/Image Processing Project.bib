  abstract = {The photoplethysmographic (PPG) waveform, also known as the pulse oximeter waveform, is one of the most commonly displayed clinical waveforms. First described in the 1930s, the technology behind the waveform is simple. The waveform, as displayed on the modern pulse oximeter, is an amplified and highly filtered measurement of light absorption by the local tissue over time. It is optimized by medical device manufacturers to accentuate its pulsatile components. Physiologically, it is the result of a complex, and not well understood, interaction between the cardiovascular, respiratory, and autonomic systems. All modern pulse oximeters extract and display the heart rate and oxygen saturation derived from the PPG measurements at multiple wavelengths. ``As is,'' the PPG is an excellent monitor for cardiac arrhythmia, particularly when used in conjunction with the electrocardiogram (ECG). With slight modifications in the display of the PPG (either to a strip chart recorder or slowed down on the monitor screen), the PPG can be used to measure the ventilator-induced modulations which have been associated with hypovolemia. Research efforts are under way to analyze the PPG using improved digital signal processing methods to develop new physiologic parameters. It is hoped that when these new physiologic parameters are combined with a more modern understanding of cardiovascular physiology (functional hemodynamics) the potential utility of the PPG will be expanded. The clinical researcher's objective is the use of the PPG to guide early goal-directed therapeutic interventions (fluid, vasopressors, and inotropes), in effect to extract from the simple PPG the information and therapeutic guidance that was previously only obtainable from an arterial pressure line and the pulmonary artery catheter.},

  abstract = {Segmentation is a critical step for many algorithms, especially for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) applications as only the skin surface provides information. Moreover, it has been shown that the rPPG signal is not distributed homogeneously across the skin. Most of the time, algorithms get input information from face detection provided by a supervised learning of physical appearance and skin pixel selection. However, both methods show several limitations. In this paper, we propose a simple approach to implicitly select skin tissues based on their distinct pulsatility feature. The input video frames are decomposed into several temporal superpixels from which the pulse signals are extracted. A pulsatility measure from each temporal superpixel is then used to merge the pulse traces and estimate the photoplethysmogram signal. Since the most pulsatile signals provide high quality information, areas where the information is predominant are favored. We evaluated our contribution using a new publicly available dataset dedicated to rPPG algorithms comparison. The results of our experiments show that our method outperforms state of the art algorithms, without any critical face or skin detection.},

The conventional watershed segmentation algorithm is not suitable for segmentation of human skin region from color images directly, since it is difficult to decide suitable color information of human skin. At first stage, the RGB image is converted into YCbCr color space which contains three components luminance, blue difference component (Cb) and red-difference component (Cr). The Cb component has been extracted and used for further processing steps. After extraction of Cb component, the modified marker based watershed algorithm has been applied for segmentation of human skin region only from RGB color image. The proposed method has been tested on FRI CVL Face Database. In experimental stage, results show that the proposed technique avoids over segmentation problem and produce good segmentation result which is comparable with the same obtained by other algorithms.},

  abstract = {Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables contact-free monitoring of the blood volume pulse using a color camera. Essentially, it detects the minute optical absorption changes caused by blood volume variations in the skin. In this paper, we show that the different absorption spectra of arterial blood and bloodless skin cause the variations to occur along a very specific vector in a normalized RGB-space. The exact vector can be determined for a given light spectrum and for given transfer characteristics of the optical filters in the camera. We show that this `signature' can be used to design an rPPG algorithm with a much better motion robustness than the recent methods based on blind source separation, and even better than the chrominance-based methods we published earlier. Using six videos recorded in a gym, with four subjects exercising on a range of fitness devices, we confirm the superior motion robustness of our newly proposed rPPG methods. A simple peak detector in the frequency domain returns the correct pulse-rate for 68\% of total measurements compared to 60\% for the best previous method, while the SNR of the pulse-signal improves from \,-\,5 dB to \,-\,4 dB. For a large population of 117 stationary subjects we prove that the accuracy is comparable to the best previous method, although the SNR of the pulse-signal drops from \,+\,8.4 dB to \,+\,7.6 dB. We expect the improved motion robustness to significantly widen the application scope of the rPPG-technique.},

For better human--computer interaction it is necessary for the machine to see people. This can be achieved by employing face detection algorithms, like the one used in the installation ``15 Seconds of Fame''. Mentioned installation unites the areas of modern art and technology. Its algorithm is based on skin colour detection. One of the problems this and similar algorithms have to deal with is sensitivity to the illumination conditions under which the input image is captured. Hence illumination sensitivity influences face detection results. One of the aspects from which we can observe illumination influence is the choice of the proper colour space. Since some colour spaces are designed to eliminate the influence of illumination (brightness) when describing colour of an object, an idea of using such a colour space for skin-colour detection has been taken under consideration and some of the methods have been researched and tested.},

We present a state-of-the-art review of rPPG-related research conducted including related processes and techniques, such as regions of interest (ROI) selection, extracting the raw signal, pre-processing data, applying noise reduction algorithms, Fast Fourier transforms (FFT), filtering and extracting these vital signs. Further, we present a detailed, critical evaluation of available rPPG systems. Limitations and future directions have also been identified to aid rPPG researchers in further advancing this field.},

Using Bland-Altman and correlation analysis, we compared the cardiac pulse rate extracted from videos recorded by a basic webcam to an FDA-approved finger blood volume pulse (BVP) sensor and achieved high accuracy and correlation even in the presence of movement artifacts. Furthermore, we applied this technique to perform heart rate measurements from three participants simultaneously.

A benchmark data set is introduced focusing on the amount of motion of the head during the measurement.},

  abstract = {Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an attractive method for noninvasive, convenient and concomitant measurement of physiological vital signals. Public benchmark datasets have served a valuable role in the development of this technology and improvements in accuracy over recent years.However, there remain gaps in the public datasets.First, despite the ubiquity of cameras on mobile devices, there are few datasets recorded specifically with mobile phone cameras. Second, most datasets are relatively small and therefore are limited in diversity, both in appearance (e.g., skin tone), behaviors (e.g., motion) and environment (e.g., lighting conditions). In an effort to help the field advance, we present the Multi-domain Mobile Video Physiology Dataset (MMPD), comprising 11 hours of recordings from mobile phones of 33 subjects. The dataset is designed to capture videos with greater representation across skin tone, body motion, and lighting conditions. MMPD is comprehensive with eight descriptive labels and can be used in conjunction with the rPPG-toolbox. The reliability of the dataset is verified by mainstream unsupervised methods and neural methods. The GitHub repository of our dataset: https://github.com/THU-CS-PI/MMPD\_rPPG\_dataset.},

  abstract = {Plethysmographic signals were measured remotely ({$>$} 1m) using ambient light and a simple consumer level digital camera in movie mode. Heart and respiration rates could be quantified up to several harmonics. Although the green channel featuring the strongest plethysmographic signal, corresponding to an absorption peak by (oxy-) hemoglobin, the red and blue channels also contained plethysmographic information. The results show that ambient light photo-plethysmography may be useful for medical purposes such as characterization of vascular skin lesions (e.g., port wine stains) and remote sensing of vital signs (e.g., heart and respiration rates) for triage or sports purposes.},

  abstract = {Monitoring physiological changes [e.g., heart rate (HR), respiration, and HR variability (HRV)] is important for measuring human emotions. Physiological responses are more reliable and harder to alter compared to explicit behaviors (such as facial expressions and speech), but they require special contact sensors to obtain. Research in the last decade has shown that photoplethysmography (PPG) signals can be remotely measured (rPPG) from facial videos under ambient light, from which physiological changes can be extracted. This promising finding has attracted much interest from researchers, and the field of rPPG measurement has been growing fast. In this article, we review current progress on intelligent signal processing approaches for rPPG measurement, including earlier works on unsupervised approaches and recently proposed supervised models, benchmark data sets, and performance evaluation. We also review studies on rPPG-based affective applications and compare them with other affective computing modalities. We conclude this article by emphasizing the current main challenges and highlighting future directions.},
