  abstract = {The photoplethysmographic (PPG) waveform, also known as the pulse oximeter waveform, is one of the most commonly displayed clinical waveforms. First described in the 1930s, the technology behind the waveform is simple. The waveform, as displayed on the modern pulse oximeter, is an amplified and highly filtered measurement of light absorption by the local tissue over time. It is optimized by medical device manufacturers to accentuate its pulsatile components. Physiologically, it is the result of a complex, and not well understood, interaction between the cardiovascular, respiratory, and autonomic systems. All modern pulse oximeters extract and display the heart rate and oxygen saturation derived from the PPG measurements at multiple wavelengths. ``As is,'' the PPG is an excellent monitor for cardiac arrhythmia, particularly when used in conjunction with the electrocardiogram (ECG). With slight modifications in the display of the PPG (either to a strip chart recorder or slowed down on the monitor screen), the PPG can be used to measure the ventilator-induced modulations which have been associated with hypovolemia. Research efforts are under way to analyze the PPG using improved digital signal processing methods to develop new physiologic parameters. It is hoped that when these new physiologic parameters are combined with a more modern understanding of cardiovascular physiology (functional hemodynamics) the potential utility of the PPG will be expanded. The clinical researcher's objective is the use of the PPG to guide early goal-directed therapeutic interventions (fluid, vasopressors, and inotropes), in effect to extract from the simple PPG the information and therapeutic guidance that was previously only obtainable from an arterial pressure line and the pulmonary artery catheter.},

  abstract = {Segmentation is a critical step for many algorithms, especially for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) applications as only the skin surface provides information. Moreover, it has been shown that the rPPG signal is not distributed homogeneously across the skin. Most of the time, algorithms get input information from face detection provided by a supervised learning of physical appearance and skin pixel selection. However, both methods show several limitations. In this paper, we propose a simple approach to implicitly select skin tissues based on their distinct pulsatility feature. The input video frames are decomposed into several temporal superpixels from which the pulse signals are extracted. A pulsatility measure from each temporal superpixel is then used to merge the pulse traces and estimate the photoplethysmogram signal. Since the most pulsatile signals provide high quality information, areas where the information is predominant are favored. We evaluated our contribution using a new publicly available dataset dedicated to rPPG algorithms comparison. The results of our experiments show that our method outperforms state of the art algorithms, without any critical face or skin detection.},

However, such instruments may cause damage to the epidermis and increase the risk of infection as well as promote discomfort to the infant. As an alternative to traditional means of monitoring heart rate, remote Photoplethysmography techniques have been surging among the scientific community. These techniques have been vastly explored for adult subjects but not for neonatal infants, who would greatly benefit from such applications. This study aims at developing a regular consumer camera-based framework for continuous and contactless extraction of the heart rate in adult subjects in challenging conditions and investigating the tool's ability to adapt to a new domain which consists of newborn subjects and the real-world conditions of a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.},

The proposed model uses signal processing and machine learning algorithms to classify blood pressure in four stages: normal, elevated, stage 1 and stage 2. A total of 83 features were extracted from the PPG signal which includes 71 statistical features and 12 characteristic features. We have used random forest classifier to train and test our predictive model. The proposed method is evaluated on publicly available MIMIC database for 20 different individuals. The database contains raw PPG data for different users and Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP) to calculate the systolic and diastolic blood pressure to be used as the ground truth for training and validation purposes. We have achieved an overall accuracy of 90.8\% over the four classes of blood pressure levels. The results indicate that the proposed model will be ideal for integration into a non-invasive blood pressure monitoring system with significant accuracy.},

  abstract = {Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate (HR) are critical physiological measures that clinicians need to observe to decide on an emergency intervention. These measures are typically determined using a contact-based pulse oximeter. This approach may pose difficulties in many cases, such as with young children, patients with burnt or sensitive skin, cognitive impairments, and those undergoing certain medical procedures or severe illnesses. Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) allows for unobtrusive sensing of these vital signs in a variety of settings for health monitoring systems. Several research studies have been conducted to use rPPG for this purpose; however, there is still not a commercially available, clinically validated system that overcomes the concerns highlighted in this paper. We present a state-of-the-art review of rPPG-related research conducted including related processes and techniques, such as regions of interest (ROI) selection, extracting the raw signal, pre-processing data, applying noise reduction algorithms, Fast Fourier transforms (FFT), filtering and extracting these vital signs. Further, we present a detailed, critical evaluation of available rPPG systems. Limitations and future directions have also been identified to aid rPPG researchers in further advancing this field.},

In particular, image classification is one of the fields where CNNs are employed with success. However, images can be heavily affected by several inconveniences such as noise or illumination. Therefore, image enhancement algorithms have been developed to improve the quality of the images. In this work, the impact that brightness and image contrast enhancement techniques have on the performance achieved by CNNs in classification tasks is analyzed. More specifically, several well known CNNs architectures such as Alexnet or Googlenet, and image contrast enhancement techniques such as Gamma Correction or Logarithm Transformation are studied.

Physiological responses are more reliable and harder to alter compared to explicit behaviors (such as facial expressions and speech), but they require special contact sensors to obtain. Research in the last decade has shown that photoplethysmography (PPG) signals can be remotely measured (rPPG) from facial videos under ambient light, from which physiological changes can be extracted. This promising finding has attracted much interest from researchers, and the field of rPPG measurement has been growing fast. In this article, we review current progress on intelligent signal processing approaches for rPPG measurement, including earlier works on unsupervised approaches and recently proposed supervised models, benchmark data sets, and performance evaluation. We also review studies on rPPG-based affective applications and compare them with other affective computing modalities. We conclude this article by emphasizing the current main challenges and highlighting future directions.},
